# Django Polls App
 In this project I have built a simple poll application. The app allows users to view polls and vote in them. The app also allows users to create polls and add questions to them. The app is built using Django as an MVC framework.
 In this project we can see all of the three layer of Django : Model, View and Controllers.

## Project Structure
 The polls folder holds the main application. The polls folder contains the following files:
    - admin.py which registers the models to the admin site.
    - apps.py which contains the configuration of the polls app.
    - models.py which contains the models of the polls app.
    - tests.py which contains the tests of the polls app.
    - urls.py which contains the urls of the polls app.
    - views.py which contains the controllers that redirect to the views of the polls app.
    The templates folder holds the templates of the polls app. Here is where the html files are stored.
    The static folder holds the static files of the polls app. Here is where the css and js files are stored.
    The manage.py file is the main file of the project. It is used to run the project.
